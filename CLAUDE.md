- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (planned)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with JSONB for flexible field definitions (Homebrew)
- **Caching**: Redis 7+ for caching and real-time message brokering (Homebrew)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs + Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate) - planned
- **Communication**: UniPile APIs for omni-channel messaging - planned

## Important Notes for Development

- **Security First**: Multi-tenant data isolation is critical - never allow cross-tenant data access
- **Schema Flexibility**: Design for maximum configurability without hardcoded entity models
- **Performance**: JSONB queries require proper GIN indexing for acceptable performance
- **Testing**: Each phase requires comprehensive unit, integration, and security tests
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed API documentation as the system grows

## When Working on This Project

1. **Read the relevant phase documentation** before implementing features
2. **Follow multi-tenant patterns** - always work within tenant context
3. **Test data isolation thoroughly** - cross-tenant data leakage is unacceptable
4. **Use JSONB strategically** - balance flexibility with query performance
5. **Plan for scale** - architecture must support 1000+ tenants efficiently
