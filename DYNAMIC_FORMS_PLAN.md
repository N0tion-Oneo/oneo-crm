# Dynamic Pipeline Forms System - Implementation Plan

## System Overview
Build a dynamic forms system that generates 5 types of forms in real-time from pipeline schema, with field-level validation configuration, smart stage-based triggers, and record sharing capabilities.

## 5 Form Types to Implement

### 1. **Full Dynamic Form (Internal)**
- All pipeline fields visible to authenticated users
- Used in record drawer, admin interfaces
- Full field access based on user permissions

### 2. **Filtered Dynamic Form (Public)**
- Only fields marked `is_visible_in_public_forms = True`
- Anonymous access at `/forms/public/{pipeline-slug}`
- Embeddable widget version available

### 3. **Stage-Specific Forms (Internal)**
- Fields required for specific pipeline stages
- Smart trigger: auto-show when record moves to stage with empty required fields
- Configured via business rules per stage

### 4. **Filtered Stage-Specific Forms (Public)**
- Public version of stage-specific forms
- **Double-filtered**: Only fields that are BOTH `is_visible_in_public_forms = True` AND required for the specific stage
- Anonymous access for completing stage-specific data
- Respects public visibility constraints even for stage-required fields

### 5. **Shared Record Forms (Public)**
- Pre-populated forms with existing record data
- Only fields marked `is_visible_in_public_forms = True` are shown with data
- Share link available in record drawer for external collaboration
- Anonymous users can view/edit shared record data
- Respects display filters - fields not visible to public remain hidden

## Implementation Architecture

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (3-4 hours)

#### 1.1 Pipeline Field Enhancements
**Extend Field model with public visibility:**
```python
# Add to pipelines/models.py Field model
is_visible_in_public_forms = models.BooleanField(default=False)
form_validation_rules = models.JSONField(default=dict)  # Field-level validation config
```

#### 1.2 Enhanced Dynamic Form Generator
**Extend `backend/forms/dynamic.py`:**
- Add `generate_form()` modes: `'internal_full'`, `'public_filtered'`, `'stage_internal'`, `'stage_public'`, `'shared_record'`
- Smart field filtering logic:
  - `internal_full`: All fields (user permission-based filtering)
  - `public_filtered`: Only `is_visible_in_public_forms = True`
  - `stage_internal`: Fields required for specific stage (all visibility)
  - `stage_public`: Fields that are BOTH `is_visible_in_public_forms = True` AND required for stage
  - `shared_record`: Public-visible fields pre-populated with record data
- Validation rule inheritance from field configuration

#### 1.3 New API Endpoints
```python
# Dynamic form schema endpoints (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
GET /api/v1/pipelines/{id}/forms/internal/  # Type 1: Full internal
GET /api/v1/public-forms/{pipeline-slug}/   # Type 2: Public filtered  
GET /api/v1/pipelines/{id}/forms/stage/{stage}/internal/  # Type 3: Stage internal
GET /api/v1/public-forms/{pipeline-slug}/stage/{stage}/   # Type 4: Stage public
GET /api/v1/pipelines/{id}/records/{record_id}/share/     # Type 5: Shared record form

# Form submission endpoints (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
POST /api/v1/pipelines/{id}/forms/submit/
POST /api/v1/public-forms/{pipeline-slug}/submit/

# Stage trigger status (✅ IMPLEMENTED)

# Pending endpoints for future phases
POST /api/v1/pipelines/{id}/records/{record_id}/generate-share-link/  # Phase 6
GET /api/v1/pipelines/{id}/forms/widget/{type}/  # Phase 4
```

#### 1.4 Smart Stage Trigger System
**Create stage transition detection:**
- Django signal on record stage change
- Check for empty required fields in new stage
- Auto-generate form URL and trigger notification
- Integration with existing business rules system

### Phase 2: Frontend Pipeline Configuration (2-3 hours)

#### 2.1 Field Configuration UI Enhancement
**Update pipeline field builder:**
- Add "Public Form Visibility" toggle in Display tab
- Add form validation rules configuration panel
- Show which forms each field will appear in

#### 2.2 Business Rules Enhancement
**Update business-rules-builder.tsx:**
- Add "Enable Stage Forms" toggle per stage
- Configure which fields trigger stage forms
- Set form display preferences (modal, drawer, redirect)

#### 2.3 Form Preview System
**Add form preview in pipeline settings:**
- Live preview of all 4 form types
- Test form submission and validation
- Generate public URLs and widget embed codes

### Phase 3: Dynamic Form Rendering Engine (4-5 hours)

#### 3.1 Core Form Renderer Component
**Create `DynamicFormRenderer.tsx`:**
```typescript
interface DynamicFormProps {
  pipelineId: string
  formType: 'internal_full' | 'public_filtered' | 'stage_internal' | 'stage_public'
  stage?: string
  recordId?: string  // For updates vs creates
  onSubmit: (data: any) => void
  embedMode?: boolean  // For widget rendering
}
```

#### 3.2 Public Form Pages
**Create public form routes:**
- `/forms/public/[pipeline-slug]/page.tsx` - Type 2: Public forms
- `/forms/public/[pipeline-slug]/stage/[stage]/page.tsx` - Type 4: Public stage forms
- Anonymous access, captcha integration, success/error handling

#### 3.3 Internal Form Integration
**Enhance existing components:**
- Update record drawer to use Type 1 forms
- Add Type 3 stage-specific form modals
- Add "Share Record" button in record drawer for Type 5 forms
- Smart trigger integration on stage changes

### Phase 4: Widget System (2-3 hours)

#### 4.1 Widget Generator
**Create widget generation system:**
- Generate iframe embed codes
- Create standalone JavaScript widgets
- Custom styling and branding options
- Cross-origin submission handling

#### 4.2 Widget Runtime
**Build widget delivery system:**
- Serve widgets at `/widgets/{pipeline-slug}/{type}.js`
- Responsive design for various container sizes
- Event handling for parent page communication

### Phase 5: Smart Triggers & Automation (2-3 hours)

#### 5.1 Stage Transition Detection
**Implement smart form triggers:**
- Detect when record moves to stage with empty required fields
- Auto-show appropriate form type (internal vs public)
- Email notifications with form completion links

#### 5.2 Form Completion Tracking
**Add completion analytics:**
- Track which fields are missing per stage
- Form completion rates and analytics
- Integration with existing monitoring system

### Phase 6: Record Sharing System (2-3 hours)

#### 6.1 Share Link Generation
**Create record sharing system:**
- Generate secure share tokens for records
- Token-based access to shared record forms
- Configurable expiration times and permissions

#### 6.2 Shared Record Forms
**Build shared record interface:**
- Pre-populate forms with existing record data
- Respect public visibility filters
- Allow external users to view/edit shared records
- Track changes and maintain audit trail

### Phase 7: Legacy Forms Cleanup (1-2 hours)

#### 7.1 Remove Old Form Components
**Delete obsolete form system:**
- Remove `frontend/src/components/forms/FormsManager.tsx`
- Remove `frontend/src/components/forms/FormBuilder.tsx`  
- Remove `frontend/src/types/forms.ts` (replace with dynamic types)
- Remove old form routes and pages

#### 7.2 Backend Forms Cleanup
**Clean up backend forms app:**
- Remove static `FormTemplate` model and related code
- Remove `FormFieldConfiguration` model (replaced by dynamic generation)
- Keep validation system but integrate with dynamic forms
- Update API endpoints to use new dynamic system only

## Field Validation Architecture

### Validation Configuration (Field Level)
**In pipeline field builder:**
```javascript
fieldConfig.validation = {
  required: boolean,
  minLength: number,
  maxLength: number,
  pattern: string,
  customRules: ValidationRule[]
}
```

### Validation Application (Form Level)
**At form render time:**
- Read field validation config from pipeline schema
- Apply validation rules to form fields dynamically
- Real-time validation with 300ms debounce
- Form-level cross-field validation support

## URL Structure

### Public Forms
- `/{tenant}.localhost:3000/forms/{pipeline-slug}` - Type 2: Public filtered forms
- `/{tenant}.localhost:3000/forms/{pipeline-slug}/stage/{stage}` - Type 4: Public stage forms
- `/{tenant}.localhost:3000/forms/shared/{pipeline-slug}/{record-id}?token={token}` - Type 5: Shared record forms

### Internal Forms
- Built into existing pipeline UI (Type 1 & 3)
- Modal/drawer interfaces for stage-specific forms

### Widgets
- `/widgets/{pipeline-slug}/public.js` - Type 2 widget
- `/widgets/{pipeline-slug}/stage/{stage}/public.js` - Type 4 widget

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **Record Drawer**: Uses Type 1 (internal full) forms
- **Business Rules**: Configures Type 3 & 4 (stage-specific) triggers
- **Pipeline Builder**: Configures field visibility and validation
- **Analytics**: Tracks form performance and completion rates

### Smart Triggers
- **Stage Change Detection**: Auto-show forms when required fields missing
- **Email Integration**: Send form completion requests
- **Workflow Integration**: Forms can trigger workflow actions

## Expected Outcomes

### For Internal Users
1. **Seamless Integration**: Forms automatically reflect pipeline changes
2. **Smart Assistance**: Forms appear when needed during stage transitions
3. **Consistent Experience**: Same field rendering as record drawer

### For External Users
1. **Easy Access**: Public forms at memorable URLs
2. **Embeddable**: Widgets work on any website
3. **Progressive**: Can complete data stage-by-stage
4. **Privacy-Aware**: Only see fields explicitly marked for public visibility, even in stage-specific forms

### For Administrators
1. **Zero Maintenance**: Forms auto-update with pipeline changes
2. **Granular Control**: Field-level visibility and validation
3. **Analytics**: Comprehensive form performance tracking
4. **Flexibility**: 4 form types cover all use cases

## Field Filtering Logic

### Type 4 Forms (Public Stage-Specific) - Double Filtering
```python
def get_stage_public_fields(pipeline, stage):
    """Get fields for public stage-specific forms"""
    return pipeline.fields.filter(
        # Must be visible in public forms
        is_visible_in_public_forms=True
    ).filter(
        # AND must be required for this specific stage
        Q(business_rules__stage_requirements__has_key=stage) &
        Q(business_rules__stage_requirements__stage__required=True)
    )
```

This ensures that even if a field is required for a stage, it won't appear in public forms unless explicitly marked as public-visible.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
- Extend existing `DynamicFormGenerator` class with double-filtering logic
- Add new API endpoints to `api/urls.py`
- Create form submission pipeline with validation
- Implement stage transition signals

### Frontend Architecture
- Create reusable `DynamicFormRenderer` component
- Add public form routes to Next.js app
- Enhance pipeline configuration UI with public visibility controls
- Build widget generation system

### Database Changes
- Add `is_visible_in_public_forms` to Field model
- Add `form_validation_rules` JSONB field
- Extend business rules schema for form triggers

This system transforms static forms into a dynamic, pipeline-integrated solution that automatically adapts to your data structure and business rules, while maintaining strict privacy controls for public access.
