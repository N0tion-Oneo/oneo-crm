# Email Conversation Threading Fix Summary

## Issue
When sending a NEW email (not a reply) while viewing an existing conversation, the new email was being incorrectly added to the existing conversation thread instead of creating a new conversation.

## Root Cause
The backend logic was using the provided `conversation_id` for ALL emails, regardless of whether they were replies or new emails.

## Fix Implemented

### 1. **Determine Email Type**
```python
# Check if this is a reply by looking for reply_to_message_id or reply_mode
is_reply = bool(reply_to_message_id or reply_mode)
```

### 2. **Conversation Handling Logic**
- **REPLY emails** (`is_reply=True`): Use the existing conversation
- **NEW emails** (`is_reply=False`): Always create a new conversation, even if `conversation_id` is provided

### 3. **Key Changes in `backend/communications/record_communications/api.py`**

#### Before:
```python
if conversation_id:
    # Always used existing conversation
    conversation = Conversation.objects.get(id=conversation_id)
```

#### After:
```python
if conversation_id and is_reply:
    # Only use existing conversation for REPLIES
    conversation = Conversation.objects.get(id=conversation_id)
elif conversation_id and not is_reply:
    # NEW email - create new conversation even if viewing existing one
    conversation = None  # Will trigger new conversation creation
```

### 4. **Response Enhancement**
The API now returns additional information when a new conversation is created:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "tracking_id": "...",
    "message": "Email sent successfully",
    "conversation_id": "new-conversation-id",
    "new_conversation_created": true
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### New Email Scenario:
- User viewing conversation A
- Composes NEW email (no reply_to_message_id or reply_mode)
- System creates NEW conversation B
- Email is sent and stored in conversation B
- Original conversation A remains unchanged

### Reply Email Scenario:
- User viewing conversation A
- Clicks Reply/Reply-All
- System uses existing conversation A
- Reply is threaded properly within conversation A

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: New Email
```bash
# Send new email while viewing existing conversation
POST /api/v1/communications/records/{record_id}/send_email/
{
    "conversation_id": "existing-conversation-id",  # Frontend sends this
    "subject": "New Topic",
    "body": "...",
    # No reply_to_message_id or reply_mode
}

# Expected: Creates NEW conversation, not added to existing
```

### Test 2: Reply Email
```bash
# Send reply email
POST /api/v1/communications/records/{record_id}/send_email/
{
    "conversation_id": "existing-conversation-id",
    "subject": "Re: Original Topic",
    "body": "...",
    "reply_to_message_id": "message-id",
    "reply_mode": "reply"
}

# Expected: Uses existing conversation, properly threaded
```

## Frontend Considerations
The frontend may need to handle the `new_conversation_created` flag to:
1. Update the UI to show the new conversation
2. Potentially redirect to the new conversation view
3. Refresh the conversation list

## Benefits
1. **Proper Email Threading**: New emails create new threads, replies stay in existing threads
2. **Better Organization**: Conversations represent actual email threads
3. **User Expectation**: Matches standard email client behavior
4. **Clear Separation**: Different topics/subjects get separate conversations
